## Who is SWaSI? 



The [<span style = "color: #DF63A4">Student Wellbeing and Success Initiative</span>](https://uoregon-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/clark13_uoregon_edu/EY4zzGdo3o9ImgpS89tM2wAB4CrNAqmPyAxDAZQ-mNuzJw){target="_blank"} is:

* an ongoing, multicohort, longitudinal research program designed to holistically understand institutional inputs to undergraduate students’ wellbeing and success across the college experience
* an educational program designed to equitably improve wellbeing and success outcomes, particularly among historically marginalized populations (e.g., first-generation students, Black students)
* an assessment and evaluation program designed to gauge whether various programmatic activities, including but not limited to the ones internal to the Initiative itself, are meeting their stated goals

Better understanding better informs us, affording opportunities to improve institutional practices that equitably support students’ learning and development and foster their achievement and persistence. Unlike many for-profit companies, which use data to sell people, this is a strategy that uses data to <span style = "color: #11E8FF">empower</span> people.

The Student Wellbeing and Success Initiative is led by Brian Clark, Assistant Director of the [<span style = "color: #DF63A4">Office of Assessment and Research</span>](https://studentlife.uoregon.edu/research){target="_blank"} in the [<span style = "color: #DF63A4">Division of Student Life</span>](https://studentlife.uoregon.edu/){target="_blank"}. It is supported primarily by the Office of the Vice President for Student Life with integral support from units of the Division of Student Life -- the [<span style = "color: #DF63A4">Department of Physical Education and Recreation</span>](https://rec.uoregon.edu/){target="_blank"}, the [<span style = "color: #DF63A4">Erb Memorial Union</span>](https://emu.uoregon.edu/){target="_blank"}, and the [<span style = "color: #DF63A4">Office of the Dean of Students</span>](https://dos.uoregon.edu/){target="_blank"} -- and across campus from many and varied units in [<span style = "color: #DF63A4">Global Engagement</span>](https://international.uoregon.edu/){target="_blank"}, the [<span style = "color: #DF63A4">Office of the Provost</span>](https://provost.uoregon.edu/), [<span style = "color: #DF63A4">Student Services and Enrollment Management</span>](https://ssem.uoregon.edu/){target="_blank"}, [<span style = "color: #DF63A4">UO Libraries</span>](https://library.uoregon.edu/){target="_blank"}, and [<span style = "color: #DF63A4">Undergraduate Education and Student Success</span>](https://uess.uoregon.edu/){target="_blank"}.

# What is this Document for?

The purposes of this document are:

1.  to conduct a comprehensive analysis of place-based belonging data
2.  to provide a general reference and resource tool for higher education professionals who do things and make decisions about things that affect students (many of those things are tied to or rooted in physical places)
3.  to describe the development of methods used to generate place-based belonging data

[This document is currently under construction and is in a "good enough for now" state]{style="color: #11E8FF"}. It will be incrementally updated through Summer 2023, which will include adding Spring 2023 data. At that point, it will be considered complete, because we intend to augment methods dramatically the following year. Forthcoming sections include an overall summary, two content sections, and the supplemental method section. Forthcoming features include alternative text for plots and images and hover text for treemaps.

## What is Place-Based Belonging?

Over the last several years, we have been incrementally exploring the concept of place-based belonging: the idea that people's affinity for physical places, or lack thereof, is intertwined with their sense of whether they fit in socially. Theoretically, it is a special case of the environmental psychology concept of place attachment ([[Altman & Low, 1992](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4684-8753-4_1){target="_blank"}]{style="color: #DF63A4"}), with conceptual focus on the place dimension over the person or process dimensions ([[Scannell & Gifford, 2010](https://uoregon-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/clark13_uoregon_edu/EUOwgiMvl5pKonwqByWz8BoBkjCnPQk0VAw9mm1fzn3XfQ?e=WW9q1Z){target="_blank"}]{style="color: #DF63A4"}) and content focus on social meanings with which places are imbued as a subset of the general affective associations people have with places. Methodologically, it departs significantly from the psychometric approach of much place attachment research (e.g., [[Williams, 2014](https://uoregon-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/clark13_uoregon_edu/EVGZxfZPNRlEoofpQI9UQz4BreUZgn5Z-W0Z7gVMNK7fdQ?e=xTznoC){target="_blank"}]{style="color: #DF63A4"}; [[Williams & Vaske, 2003](https://uoregon-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/clark13_uoregon_edu/EVXdi_qf-_hPpRc_iruUoNwBJ1ma0fuw3ZHknWZWW2YAXQ?e=pVPMkt){target="_blank"}]{style="color: #DF63A4"}), aligning more closely with cultural mapping. Cultural mapping is an interdisciplinary field broadly tied together by a mode of inquiry and general methodology that reckons with documenting a community's place-based features and assets for a wide range of purposes. See [[Duxbury et al. (2015)](https://uoregon-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/clark13_uoregon_edu/EQSU3UqGrw1GpScojaHKFVUBLiH2uuzMOtTlFmkpMoEr6w?e=jE9T38){target="_blank"}]{style="color: #DF63A4"} for an introduction and the [[whole book](https://www.routledge.com/Cultural-Mapping-as-Cultural-Inquiry/Duxbury-Garrett-Petts-MacLennan/p/book/9780367599003){target="_blank"}]{style="color: #DF63A4"} for varied perspectives. Place-based belonging, specifically, has roots in humanistic and cultural geography traditions, which feed into cultural mapping, and is depicted by a kind of symbol mapping ([[Soini, 2001](https://uoregon-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/clark13_uoregon_edu/EVIw9hlo0LdGkCrxUpVFoYwBg__H3LRwrnGmUAavpQ1pRg?e=JyQV4u)]{style="color: #DF63A4"}).

Adapting methods from [<span style = "color: #DF63A4">Pitcher & Royal (2016)](https://uoregon-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/clark13_uoregon_edu/ETDssdQ-bW1LsSA_db4aaVgBd_vO02wIffeQ_AqgQ3TgwQ?e=yBVY5o){target="_blank"}, we ask students to click up to three places on a campus map they feel like they "belong, fit in, are connected, are accepted, etc.," and separately, to click up to three places they feel like they "[do not]{style="color: #11E8FF"} belong, [do not]{style="color: #11E8FF"} fit in, are [dis]{style="color: #11E8FF"}connected, are [not]{style="color: #11E8FF"} accepted, etc." After clicking "belong" and "don't belong" places on a campus map, we follow up about select places to try and understand more about them. Generally, we ask students to describe in text why they feel the ways they do about the places. A unique aspect of follow-up involves delving into the Erb Memorial Union (EMU), which is a compact set of places, which cannot be disaggregated given a campus map and which form a unified place we call the EMU. If a student clicks on the EMU at the campus level, we follow up with a map of the EMU and ask them to click on places within the EMU they feel like they belong and don't belong, and then ask them to describe why. (Map and follow-up methods have varied over the years of development. See [[Supplemental Method](#supmeth)]{style="color: #DF63A4"} for more details.)

The methods above generate data that allow us to do several things:

-   describe a place and rank-order multiple places in terms of belong and don't belong sentiments
-   describe a place and rank-order multiple places in terms of inclusiveness, which is a combination of both belong and don't belong sentiments
-   disaggregate a place's inclusiveness by demographics
-   explore why places have belong or don't belong sentiments associated with them
-   describe how places relate to each other through belong and don't belong sentiments

### Focus

You need not read or even look at ***all*** of this document at any given time. You need not understand all of it the first time you look at it. You need not remember all of it no matter how many times you look at it. You will not be tested on it. It will be available for reference when you need it. And you can ask questions about it when they occur to you.

The document is generally geared toward exploring place-based belonging through visualization and description.

### Flow

```{r include = FALSE}
waves<- c("Spring 2022, Spring 2020, Spring 2019, Spring 2018")
```

There are six main sections after this one:

-   [[Summary](#summary)]{style="color: #DF63A4"}
    -   This section is forthcoming and will contain the overall take-home message. It will be the last section produced after other content sections are completed.
-   [[Where?](#where)]{style="color: #DF63A4"}
    -   This section contains interactive tables of place-based belonging metrics, heat maps of clicks on places, and treemaps and bar plots of place inclusiveness.
    -   It is organized hierarchically by three levels: 1. population (US undergraduate, international, graduate); 2. wave (`r waves`); 3. year in school (4th-year, 3rd-year, 2nd-year, 1st-year).
        -   Spring 2021 is missing due to remote operations during the pandemic.
        -   Heat maps include Spring 2017 but tables, treemaps, and bar plots do not because clicks were not yet quantified.
-   [[Why There?](#why)]{style="color: #DF63A4"}
    -   This section contains wordnets of adjacent adjective-noun pairs from, wordclouds of keywords from, and emotion classifications of students' descriptions of why they feel they ways they do about places.
    -   It is organized hierarchically by two levels: 1. population (US undergraduate, international, graduate); 2. place (Erb Memorial Union, Lokey Science Complex, and University Housing contain nested subordinate places for US undergraduates).
-   [[Where for Whom?](#whom)]{style="color: #DF63A4"}
    -   This section is forthcoming and will contain inclusiveness of popular places disaggregated by demographics.
-   [[Between Here and Where?](#between)]{style="color: #DF63A4"}
    -   This section is forthcoming and will contain networks of places based on "belong" and "don't belong" sentiments.
-   [[Supplemental Method](#supmeth)]{style="color: #DF63A4"}
    -   This section is forthcoming. It currently contains a Figure referenced in wordcloud notes and will contain detailed information about method development, procedure, and analysis. For now, methodological information is contained in notes.

# Summary {#cross}

None of this is right. :)

Cross-references make it easier for your readers to find and link to elements in your book.

## Chapters and sub-chapters


There are two steps to cross-reference any heading:

1. Label the heading: `# Hello world {#nice-label}`. 
    - Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, `# Hello world` = `# Hello world {#hello-world}`.
    - To label an un-numbered heading, use: `# Hello world {-#nice-label}` or `{# Hello world .unnumbered}`.

1. Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using `\@ref(nice-label)`; for example, please see Chapter \@ref(cross). 
    - If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: [any text you want can go here](#cross).

## Captioned figures and tables

Figures and tables *with captions* can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using `\@ref(fig:chunk-label)` and `\@ref(tab:chunk-label)`, respectively.

See Figure \@ref(fig:nice-fig).

```{r nice-fig, fig.cap='Here is a nice figure!', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center', fig.alt='Plot with connected points showing that vapor pressure of mercury increases exponentially as temperature increases.'}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1))
plot(pressure, type = 'b', pch = 19)
```

Don't miss Table \@ref(tab:nice-tab).

```{r nice-tab, tidy=FALSE}
knitr::kable(
  head(pressure, 10), caption = 'Here is a nice table!',
  booktabs = TRUE
)
```

Note: All columns are sortable. The default sorting is alphabetical order of Aggregated Place then Place. The Aggregated Place column is searchable. Scroll right to see more metrics on the right side of the table. Use the "Show" dropdown to elongate the table up to 100 rows. Click "Previous," "Next," or numbers between to move through pages. The table is hierarchically organized: Place within Aggregated Place. Click the triangle next to an Aggregated Place to drop down its list of subordinate Places. Parentheses to the right of Aggregated Place names denote how many subordinate places there are (1 = Aggregated Place and Place are identical). An aggregated place combines places in the Place column that are spatial (e.g., Lokey Science Complex) or conceptual (e.g., University Housing) clusters of many places. Most aggregation is based on campus maps, but the Erb Memorial Union has its own maps and data collection. Consequently, the "Erb Memorial Union" entry in the Aggregated Place column contains campus-level data and the "EMU-Specific Places" entry contains EMU-level data. <span style = "color: #11E8FF">Inclusive</span> is a percentage indicating how inclusive a place is and is computed by *n* Belong / (*n* Belong + *n* Don't Belong) * 100. <span style = "color: #49C1AD; font-style: italic">n</span> <span style = "color: #11E8FF">Belong</span> and <span style = "color: #49C1AD; font-style: italic">n</span> <span style = "color: #11E8FF">Don't Belong</span> are raw counts of how many clicks a place accrued on the "belong" map or "don't belong" map, respectively. <span style = "color: #11E8FF">Click Belong</span> and <span style = "color: #11E8FF">Click Don't Belong</span> are percentages indicating the extent to which a place is considered somewhere students feel like they belong or don't belong, respectively, relative to other places. They are computed by dividing *n* Belong and *n* Don't Belong by the total number of Belong or Don't Belong clicks, respectively, and multiplied by 100. <span style = "color: #11E8FF">Student Belong</span> and <span style = "color: #11E8FF">Student Don't Belong</span> are percentages indicating the extent to which students agree that a place is somewhere they feel they belong or don't belong, respectively. They are computed by dividing *n* Belong and *n* Don't Belong by the total numbers of students who contributed data to those *n*s, respectively. In other words, inclusive, *n* Belong, *n* Don't Belong, Click Belong, and Click Don't Belong are all <span style = "color: #11E8FF">place-based metrics</span>, whereas Student Belong and Student Don't Belong are <span style = "color: #11E8FF">person-based metrics</span>. Because this overall table combines data from multiple academic years and because both places and methods have changed over the years, there is some inaccuracy in representing some places. For example, Unthank Hall did not exist before Spring 2022 data collection and Lokey Science Complex was disaggregated in map regions after Spring 2018. So, Unthank's metrics are likely underestimated, and Lokey Science Complex appears as both an aggregated place and a subordinate place (Spring 2018) with legitimate subordinate places that make up Lokey Science Complex (Spring 2019, Spring 2020, Spring 2022). Spring 2022: Mostly first-year, second-year, third-year, fourth-year, and fifth-year (i.e., 2021-22, 2020-21, 2019-20, 2018-19, and, 2017-18 cohorts, respectively) US undergraduates contributed data, along with a few n-year (i.e., a few from 2002-02, 2007-08, 2010-11, 2011-12, 2014-15, and 2016-17 cohorts) and US exchange undergraduates. East Lawn was mislabeled as West Lawn. So, there is no distinction between East and West Lawns. Spring 2020: First-year, second-year, third-year, fourth-year, and fifth-year (i.e., 2019-20, 2018-19, 2017-18, 2016-17, and 2015-16 cohorts, respectively) US undergraduates contributed data. Spring 2019: First-year, second-year, third-year, and fourth-year (i.e., 2018-19, 2017-18, 2016-17, and 2015-16 cohorts, respectively) US undergraduates contributed data. Baker was mislabeled as Barnhart. So, there is no distinction between Baker and Barnhart. And no region was drawn for Autzen Stadium. Therefore, no click data exist for Autzen. Spring 2018: First-year, second-year, and third-year (i.e., 2017-18, 2016-17, and 2015-16 cohorts, respectively) US undergraduates contributed data. Total *n*~ClickBelong~ = `r big_n(nc_cam_us_ug[1,1])`; total *n*~ClickDon'tBelong~ = `r big_n(nc_cam_us_ug[1,2])`. Total *n*~StudentBelong~ = `r big_n(ns_cam_us_ug[1,1])`; total *n*~StudentDon'tBelong~ = `r big_n(ns_cam_us_ug[1,2])`. Again because this overall table combines data from multiple academic years, some students contributed data more than once. Most students contributed to only one wave of data collection (*n* = `r big_n(nw_cam_us_ug$n[nw_cam_us_ug$n_waves == 1])`, `r stat_1(nw_cam_us_ug$n[nw_cam_us_ug$n_waves == 1]/sum(nw_cam_us_ug$n)*100)`%), some students contributed to two waves (*n* = `r big_n(nw_cam_us_ug$n[nw_cam_us_ug$n_waves == 2])`, `r stat_1(nw_cam_us_ug$n[nw_cam_us_ug$n_waves == 2]/sum(nw_cam_us_ug$n)*100)`%), and relatively few students contributed to three waves (*n* = `r big_n(nw_cam_us_ug$n[nw_cam_us_ug$n_waves == 3])`, `r stat_1(nw_cam_us_ug$n[nw_cam_us_ug$n_waves == 3]/sum(nw_cam_us_ug$n)*100)`%). See [<span style = "color: #DF63A4">Supplemental Method</span>](#supmeth) for more details. Table was generated using the `reactable` package.

Because this overall table combines data from multiple academic years, there is some inaccuracy in representing some places. However, because data are limited to Spring 2020 and Spring 2022 and methods were consistent between those waves, apart from a minor mislabeling of lawn regions, inaccuracy in representing places is due to physical changes in places, with the main changes being Unthank and Knight Campus construction. Spring 2022: Degree-seeking (first-year and second-year) and exchange international undergraduates and degree-seeking international graduates contributed data. East Lawn was mislabeled as West Lawn. So, there is no distinction between East and West Lawns. Spring 2020: Freshman, Sophomore, Junior and Senior degree-seeking international undergraduates contributed data.

Some names of places with lower popularity were abbreviated to fit the text in their respective rectangles: <span style = "color: #11E8FF">TF</span> = Turf Field, <span style = "color: #11E8FF">DS</span> = Duck Store, <span style = "color: #11E8FF">Barn</span> = Outdoor Program Barn, <span style = "color: #11E8FF">Cas</span> = Cascade, <span style = "color: #11E8FF">FAS</span> = Fine Art Studios, <span style = "color: #11E8FF">MNL</span> = Many Nations Longhouse, <span style = "color: #11E8FF">MS</span> = LERC Military Science, <span style = "color: #11E8FF">MNCH</span> = Museum of Natural and Cultural History, <span style = "color: #11E8FF">Moss</span> = Moss Street Children's Center, <span style = "color: #11E8FF">Fent</span> = Fenton, <span style = "color: #11E8FF">LLC</span> = Living Learning Center, <span style = "color: #11E8FF">Essl</span> = Esslinger, <span style = "color: #11E8FF">BCC</span> = Black Cultural Center, <span style = "color: #11E8FF">Mac</span> = McArthur Court, <span style = "color: #11E8FF">Saun Stad</span> = Saunders Stadium, <span style = "color: #11E8FF">Friend</span> = Friendly, <span style = "color: #11E8FF">TI</span> = Tennis Indoor, span style = "color: #49C1AD">PLC</span> = Prince Lucien Campbell. Because this overall treemap combines data from multiple academic years and because both places and methods have changed over the years, there is some inaccuracy in representing popularity and inclusiveness (treemaps within academic years are accurate, and because there are fewer available data, overall treemap for international students is accurate in this respect despite combining data). For example, Unthank Hall did not exist before Spring 2022 data collection and Lokey Science Complex was disaggregated in map regions after Spring 2018. So, Unthank's popularity is likely underestimated and its inclusiveness may be, too, and Lokey Science Complex (Spring 2018) is depicted on the treemap along with places that make up Lokey Science Complex (Spring 2019, Spring 2020, Spring 2022). Spring 2022: Mostly first-year, second-year, third-year, fourth-year, and fifth-year (i.e., 2021-22, 2020-21, 2019-20, 2018-19, and, 2017-18 cohorts, respectively) US undergraduates contributed data, along with a few n-year (i.e., a few from 2002-02, 2007-08, 2010-11, 2011-12, 2014-15, and 2016-17 cohorts) and US exchange undergraduates. East Lawn was mislabeled as West Lawn. So, there is no distinction between East and West Lawns. Spring 2020: First-year, second-year, third-year, fourth-year, and fifth-year (i.e., 2019-20, 2018-19, 2017-18, 2016-17, and 2015-16 cohorts, respectively) US undergraduates contributed data. Spring 2019: First-year, second-year, third-year, and fourth-year (i.e., 2018-19, 2017-18, 2016-17, and 2015-16 cohorts, respectively) US undergraduates contributed data. Baker was mislabeled as Barnhart. So, there is no distinction between Baker and Barnhart. And no region was drawn for Autzen Stadium. Therefore, no click data exist for Autzen. Spring 2018: First-year, second-year, and third-year (i.e., 2017-18, 2016-17, and 2015-16 cohorts, respectively) US undergraduates contributed data.

Again because this overall treemap combines data from multiple academic years, some students contributed data more than once. Most students contributed to only one wave of data collection (`r big_n(nw_cam_us_ug$n[nw_cam_us_ug$n_waves == 1])`, `r stat_1(nw_cam_us_ug$n[nw_cam_us_ug$n_waves == 1]/sum(nw_cam_us_ug$n)*100)`%), some students contributed to two waves (`r big_n(nw_cam_us_ug$n[nw_cam_us_ug$n_waves == 2])`, `r stat_1(nw_cam_us_ug$n[nw_cam_us_ug$n_waves == 2]/sum(nw_cam_us_ug$n)*100)`%), and relatively few students contributed to three waves (`r big_n(nw_cam_us_ug$n[nw_cam_us_ug$n_waves == 3])`, `r stat_1(nw_cam_us_ug$n[nw_cam_us_ug$n_waves == 3]/sum(nw_cam_us_ug$n)*100)`%).

Inclusiveness is a percentage indicating how inclusive a place is and is computed by by *n* Belong / (*n* Belong + *n* Don't Belong) * 100. Yellow represents the high end of the inclusiveness continuum and black represents the low end. Color mapping to inclusiveness percentages comports with the treemaps in the "Disaggregated and Less Delimited" section, and is thus variable across plots. "Aggregated" = some individual places were combined into larger places (e.g., residence halls into University Housing). "More Delimited" = the criterion for inclusion of a place in a plot was $\geq$ 0.1 of the total proportion of clicks, where total proportion of clicks was defined as the total number of clicks on a place divided by the average of the total number of clicks across all places, which is more delimited than the criterion used in "Less Delimited."

Inclusiveness is a percentage indicating how inclusive a place is and is computed by by *n* Belong / (*n* Belong + *n* Don't Belong) * 100. Yellow represents the high end of the inclusiveness continuum and black represents the low end. Color mapping to inclusiveness percentages comports with the treemaps in the "Disaggregated and Less Delimited" section, and is thus variable across plots.

"More Delimited" = the criterion for inclusion of a place in a plot was $\geq$ 0.1 of the total proportion of clicks, where total proportion of clicks was defined as the total number of clicks on a place divided by the average of the total number of clicks across all places, which is more delimited than the criterion used in "Less Delimited." Clicks on Lawn, Other, and Out of Bounds regions were omitted prior to computing total proportion of clicks.

Yellow represents the high end of the inclusiveness continuum and black represents the low end. Gray text represents inclusiveness $\gt$ 75%. The criterion for inclusion of a place in the treemap was total click count of at least 20. The criterion for presentation of a treemap was at least 4 places represented. Additionally, all treemaps omit clicks on Other and Out of Bounds regions. **SSC** = Student Sustainability Center, **Hallway 1** = the East wing hallway on level 1 that runs in front of the Multicultural Center, **Hallway 2** = the East wing hallway on level 2 that runs in front of the the Center for Student Involvement Resource Center and the Redwood Auditorium. Because this overall treemap combines data from multiple academic years and because both places and methods have changed over the years, there is some inaccuracy in representing popularity and inclusiveness (treemaps within academic years are accurate). Spring 2022: Mostly first-year, second-year, third-year, fourth-year, and fifth-year (i.e., 2021-22, 2020-21, 2019-20, 2018-19, and, 2017-18 cohorts, respectively) US undergraduates contributed data, along with a few n-year (i.e., a few from 2002-02, 2007-08, 2010-11, 2011-12, 2014-15, and 2016-17 cohorts) and US exchange undergraduates.
